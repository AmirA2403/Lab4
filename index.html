    <h2>Background:</h2>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in <u>Tehran, Iran</u>. I moved to the UAE to study
      architecture and then returned to Iran. Due to economic and political
      hardship, we decided to move, and about three years ago, I immigrated to
      Canada with my wife and our newborn son, where we've made our permanent
      home.

    <h2>Goals:</h2>
    <p>
      I truly aspire to become a skilled front-end or back-end developer, even
      though I've never had the opportunity to formally study these subjects in
      a traditional academic setting.
